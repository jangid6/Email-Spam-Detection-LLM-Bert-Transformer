# Email-Classification-Spam-Detection-LLM-Bert-Transformer

The goal of this project is to create an easy to use program that will help classify incoming emails into their appropriate binary classes.   

This was achieved by finetuning a pretrained text classification `bert-base-uncased` model on a very small dataset in order to implement email classification for incoming emails.
